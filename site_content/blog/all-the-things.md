This post starts with a long section of text, since I expect that's what most posts will start with. That sentence isn't long enough so I'll add another one. A short sentence too. Almost there, this text just needs to be at least...let's say 3 lines. I don't think that's long enough yet. I guess I could have used the "lorem ipsum" text for this, but typing this all out is more fun I guess. Maybe. Ok that might be long enough.

# A large header
That's the biggest header. Wow, so big. I'll take this opportunity to put a code block:
```rust
fn a_function(stuff: &[i32]) -> bool {
    if stuff.len() > 2 {
        true
    } else {
        false
    }
}
```
Wow, that sure is some code. Better copy and paste that directly into your editor to make your code better. Note how `a_function` returns a `bool`. Neat.

## A smaller header
This header isn't the biggest. It's still bigger than this text though. How about a table?

|column 1|column 2|a long column 3|
|--------|--------|---------------|
|a value|another value|value|
|hello|i'm table|sup|
|a long value|value yay|something|

Fantastic. And there should also be *some text in italics* and **some bold text** too. And don't forget to ~~cross out~~ stuff. Oh I almost forget, gotta put a footnote[^1] near the top to test that out too. And [a regular link](/) is probably good to have.

### An even smaller header
Ok these headers are starting to get pretty small. Like that's barely even a header at this point. Anyway, here's a list of things:
* something
* something else
* a third thing

But what if you want numbers? Well that's fine:
1. the first thing
1. the second thing
1. the third thing

Don't forget about the second footnote[^2]. This seems like a good place to put a horizontal rule.

Neato.

Oh and nested lists:
* do a thing
    * something
    * another thing
* do some other thing
    1. gotta do this first
    1. then do this

# Back to big headers
How about a blockquote?

Wow isn't that dumb. Let's all make fun of whoever said that quote.

Oh no

Wow this post is lookin like a real thing. At least in the editor it does.

Oh I forgot about nested blockquotes:

Ok I think that's everything. Hopefully this is long enough so the footnotes require scrolling to get to.

[^1]: And here's a footnote way down here

[^2]: A second footnote can't hurt
