# It's a header
It's some stuff under a header

## Ooh a smaller header
Neat[^1]

This has some `code`
```rust
fn its_rust() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

Let's try a ~~tlable~~ ~~talbal~~ ~~trambampoline~~ table

|column 1|column 2|
|--------|--------|
|value 1|value 2|
|value 3|value 4|

This text has to be long enough to test out the footnotes. Also I want a line long enough that it has to wrap around. I'll have to type some more stuff to get that to happen. Ok I think that should be long enough.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaah

aah

ah


Here is more stuff

# Oh headers are big
# They take up more space
# This is a big header
# Yay for headers

How about an unordered list:
* an item
* another item

And an ordered list:
1. this is first
1. and this is second

And a link: [home](/)

Ok I think it'll be long enough if I add more headers

# Ooooo
## Ooooo
### Ooooo
#### Ooooo
##### Ooooo
###### Ooooo
####### Ooooo

Whoops I guess there are only 6 levels of header
# Ooo
